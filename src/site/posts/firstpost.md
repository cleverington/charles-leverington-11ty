I'm going to outline right here that Blogging using Markdown only isn't _enough_!

I've written this page entirely in Markdown, but only as a stop-gap so there "is" at least one post.

Once the actual 'Porfolio App' is in place, I plan on actually adding a 'Page Builder' style component system to the Posts, Pages, and Showcases content-types.  Splash in some Netlify CMS and bam!
